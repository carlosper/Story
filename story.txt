This is a story 
about a business trip 
I took to Hong 
Kong.  The trip 
started like most trips
, at the airport
.  The flight to 
Hong Kong was uneventful
, unless you call 
12 hours in a 
cramped space with the 
worlds number one airplane 
villain uneventful.  Oh
, the villain in 
this story, as 
with all long airplane 
flights, is the 
young child hopped up 
on sugar for the 
first 7 hours of 
the flight and then 
screaming for the remaining 
5 hours.  Luckily 
back then, (
1999), we had 
something called Ambien that 
allowed for a peaceful 
and restful flight over
.  Now if you
've never been 
to Hong Kong, 
it's fantastic
.  They guide you 
through customs, get 
you in the appropriate 
transport and off to 
your hotel.  So 
I arrive at the 
hotel late in the 
evening, check-
in and dream about 
a shower and sleep
.  One little thing 
they failed to mention 
is the key fob 
on the hotel room 
chain is to be 
inserted in an outlet 
to get the lights 
to turn on.  
After about 10 minutes 
looking like an American
, I finally slinked 
down to the front 
desk and asked for 
assistance.  So this 
was the first 24 
hours of my trip 
and I was thinking 
how funny life can 
be.  One moment 
sitting in an airplane 
very uncomfortable and the 
next looking like a 
complete idiot.
